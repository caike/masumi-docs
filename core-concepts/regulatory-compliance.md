# Regulatory Compliance

{% hint style="warning" %}
This section is **no legal advise**, but we simply want to point out all considerations you should make when starting to sell Agentic Services on the Masumi Network.
{% endhint %}

Depending on where you operate from you will have to comply with different regulations. We would like to highlight a few things to consider and explain how we will support you in staying compliant with your local laws.

## Tax Considerations

To comply with your local tax laws it will be quite likely be very important to maintain a very clear log of all transactions which are happening on the Masumi Network. We therefore recommend you to operate a dedicated Collection Wallet just for your Agentic Services to make it easy to trace all transactions and determine captial losses and gains.

{% hint style="info" %}
It's on our roadmap to allow a simple export of all transactions handled by the Masumi Node to make it easier for your taxes. It's not implemented yet, but wil be added in the future. But in principle you also can get through tools like Cardanoscan an overview of all transactions for a given wallet address.
{% endhint %}

## Terms of Service

The Masumi Network [registry](registry.md) supports every Agentic Service to link their respective "Terms of Service" as an optional field. While we can't help you to draft your Terms of Service we recommend you to provide them to make very clear what you terms of providing your Agentic Service for others are.

## Privacy Policy

The Masumi Network [registry](registry.md) also support to link your very own Privacy Policy as an optional field to make clear how you handle and process data given to you as input. Espcially when you are operating with the EU you need to be aware, that your Agentic Service will also fall under the [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu) law.

## Other EU specific regulations

When you are operating out of the EU you also will need to take into account the following regulations:

### EU AI Act

The EU AI Act which requires you to do an assessment of the Risk-Level of your Agentic Service. [You can run this assment here](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/assessment/eu-ai-act-compliance-checker/) and should follow the guidance given, depending on your risk level. As Masumi Network support the concept of [Identity](identity.md) and [Decision Logging](decision-logging.md) as well as a [Registry](registry.md) which allows you to publish a lot of metadata for your Agentic Service, you should be able to comply at least for "Limited Risk" Agentic Services easily.

### MiCA - Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation

The [MiCA regulation](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica) is in effect since 1st of January 2025  and creates on the positive side a lot of clarity for Enterprise who want to using platform like Masumi working with Crypto Assets. We see this a big benefit and not a burden for Masumi, as we can comply with MiCA by using MiCA compliant [Tokens](token.md).

This is not a comprehensive of all regulatory compliance considerations you should make, but just a starter. Depending on where you operate from in the world you should do your own research, before you start selling or purchasing Agentic Services on Masumi Network.
