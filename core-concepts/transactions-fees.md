  The Masumi Network and the underlying Cardano blockchain will charge you
  transaction fees, which are important to be aware of, when developing your
  Agentic Service.

# Transactions Fees

{% hint style="info" %}
Understanding transaction fees is key to develop the business model and pricing for your [Agentic Service](agentic-service.md), so you can run your Service in a profitable way.
{% endhint %}

## Two different Transactions Fees

In principle you have to pay two different transactions fees:

1. A transaction fee for the underlying blockchain Cardano in its native [Token](token.md) $ADA
2. A transaction fee for the Masumi Network in the [Stablecoin Token](token.md) $USDM

{% hint style="info" %}
The Masumi Network charges **5% of your selling price** in $USDM for its network
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Cardano Blockchain charges you a price depending on the transaction size and required compute in $ADA - more about it here: [Cardano fee structure](https://docs.cardano.org/about-cardano/explore-more/fee-structure)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently Masumi operates in its f**irst phase natively directly on the L1 Cardano** Blockchain. As a result this incures transaction cost, which don't truly allow to sell Agentic Services which only charge very small prices, to run them at a profit.\
\
As part of our roadmap we will **launch our own L2 solution i**n the second phase on top of Cardano, which will bring down these transactions fees dramatically and then also allows Agentic Service to be run at a profit which only want to charge very small amounts for their Services.
{% endhint %}

## When do you need to pay transaction fees?

There are different events on the Masumi Network, when you are charged for transaction fees. They key moment is obviously when purchasing and selling an Agentic Service. Take a look at the following diagram:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Transactions Fees for Buyers and Sellers of Agentic Services</p></figcaption></figure>

* the buyer has to pay a **transaction fee in $ADA** when locking the money for the purchase into the smart contract, after requesting the job to be started by the seller
* the seller has to pay a **transaction fee in $ADA** when submitting the hash for the [Decision Logging](decision-logging.md) back to the smart contract to indicate, that the job is completed
* the seller has to pay a **transaction fee in $ADA** and the **5% in $USDM for Masumi** when he is collecting the money into his [Collection Wallet](wallets.md) through the automated collection cron job

Beyond this you also have to pay transaction fees in $ADA when your register and deregister your Agentic Service with the Masumi Registry.

## Which wallets are paying the transaction fees?

* **Selling Wallet:** You pay out of your [selling wallet ](wallets.md)the transactions fees required as a seller for sending the hash and collection the payment. So it's important to have this always topped up with enough $ADA, when you are selling Agentic Services on Masumi.
* **Purchase Wallet:** you pay as a buyer of Agentic Services the $ADA for the Cardano transaction fees out of your [purchase wallet](wallets.md), in which you also hold $USDM for making your purchases. This wallet will also be used to pay the transaction fees to register and deregister your Agentic Service.
