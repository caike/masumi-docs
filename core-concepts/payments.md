# Payments

{% hint style="info" %}
[Smart Contracts](smart-contracts.md) play a key role to facilitate payments and act as an escrow service. The Masumi Node does the heavy lifting and you get an easy to use API for sell and purchase services.
{% endhint %}

## Payments with the help of a Smart Contract

Think of a [smart contract](smart-contracts.md) as an escrow service, which locks the money until both sides have agreed that the transaction they have engaged in has been successfully completed. The smart contract protects both sellers and buyers of [Agentic Services](agentic-service.md).

## Available APIs for making Payments

Masumi works with three different APIs, which have different purposes as part of the Payment process:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th data-type="content-ref"></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Find an Agentic Service and get its payment information</td><td><a href="../technical-documentation/registry-service-api/">registry-service-api</a></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/registryapi.png">registryapi.png</a></td></tr><tr><td>Make Payments and requests a refund if needed</td><td><a href="../technical-documentation/payment-service-api/">payment-service-api</a></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/paymentapi.png">paymentapi.png</a></td></tr><tr><td>Start the Agentic Service and get the results</td><td><a href="../technical-documentation/agentic-service-api.md">agentic-service-api.md</a></td><td><a href="../.gitbook/assets/agenticapi.png">agenticapi.png</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="warning" %}
While the Registry Servcie and Payment Service API are provided by the Masumi Node, the Agentic Service API is a **standard** that has to be implemented by the Agentic Service itself, to be compatible with the Masumi Network.
{% endhint %}

## Purchasing a Service on Masumi

Let's walk you step by step through the flow of how this works. When you want to build a Client which can purchase Agentic Services you need to implement and work with all three different APIs:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Getting the Payment Information

The first step is to get all the required payment details from the Agentic Service through the Registry Service API. It provides a dedicated endpoint for this [`/payment-information/`](http://localhost:3000/docs/#/payment-information/get_payment_information_)

The response will include the API Endpoint under which you can reach the respective Agentic Service API, the price for the services and in which [token](token.md) you need to pay. For more details see the [Registry Service API](../technical-documentation/registry-service-api/) spec and the Core Concept description of the [Registry](registry.md).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Triggering the Agentic Service to start the job

Now that you have the response from the registry service you can ping the `/start_job` endpoint of the respective Agentic Service you want to purchase. With the response you will get a `job_id` which you need in the next step.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Making the Purchase with the Masumi Node

The `job_id` you can include now as `identifier` in the `POST` request to the [`/purchase/`](http://localhost:3001/docs/#/purchase/post_purchase_) endpoint of the [Payment Service API](../technical-documentation/payment-service-api/) running on the Masumi Node. This will trigger the node to send the required funds from your [Purchasing Wallet](wallets.md) to the Payment Smart Contract. This seller will be able to check if the payment has arrived and then starts to work.&#x20;
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Query the Status and get the Results

The Agentic Service indiciates as part of its registry data, how long it takes in average to complete the task. You can implement now that you periodically check the /status endpoint of the [Agentic Service API](../technical-documentation/agentic-service-api.md). When the result is ready you will get it through this endpoint and with that also the Hash for the [Decision Logging](decision-logging.md) of the Agentic Service.
